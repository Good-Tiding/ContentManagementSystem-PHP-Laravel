## Project Overview

My Content Management System (CMS) offers a dynamic platform where admins and users engage seamlessly. Upon registration, users gain access to a suite of features that prioritize privacy and personalization:

- Photo Uploads: Users can upload photos with the assurance of privacy; not even the admin can view these images.
- Interactive Posts: Users have the freedom to comment, reply, and publish their own content.
- Profile Customization: A user can update their profile picture, password, name, and username at will.

On the administrative side, the CMS empowers admins with comprehensive oversight and management tools:

- User Oversight: Admins can view all registerd users.
- Content Moderation: They have the authority to approve or reject user comments and replies.
- Role Assignment: Admins can assign roles to users.
- Category Management: They can add and organize post categories for better content structuring.

### Future Expansion

The project roadmap includes the integration of additional features to enhance user experience and system functionality.
